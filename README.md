# -Cloud-Data-Engineering-Project-From-Data-Ingestion-to-Insights
Built an end-to-end cloud data pipeline for Airbnb data, transforming raw CSV files into analytics-ready datasets using Snowflake, dbt, and AWS S3. Implemented a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold) with incremental loading and Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) to track historical changes.
